### Immutable

This library is built without any mutable data and should remain so. The library [immutable-js](https://immutable-js.com/) is used.

### Tests

Code is fully tested using mocha and testcontainers-js, so you don't have to boot your own clickhouse instance to run tests.

Simply run
```sh
yarn test
```
